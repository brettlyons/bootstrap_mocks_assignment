             It only took me six days. Same time it took the Lord to make the world. That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. You wouldn't hit a man with no trousers on, would you? Bruce... I'm God. Your were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off. Circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. Multiply your anger by about a hundred, Kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. No, this is Mount Everest. You should flip on the Discovery Channel from time to time. But I guess you can't now, being dead and all. Yes, I used a machine gun. Mister Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when I'm asked, I don't have to lie. But don't think of me as an idiot. I did the same thing to Gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you.
